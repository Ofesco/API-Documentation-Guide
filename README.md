## Getting Started :walking:

This section provides a foundational guide to getting started with API development. Setting up your development environment and understanding the necessary tools and technologies are crucial steps before diving into creating APIs.

### Development Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following components set up:

1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Choose an IDE that supports the programming languages and frameworks you plan to use for API development. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.
2. **Version Control System:** Use a version control system (such as Git) to manage your codebase. Host your repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaboration and version tracking.

### Tools and Technologies 

Understanding the tools and technologies involved in API development is essential for efficient coding and testing. Consider the following:

1. **Programming Language:** Select a programming language that suits your project's requirements. Common languages for API development include Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, Ruby, and PHP.
2. **Web Frameworks:** Choose a web framework that simplifies API development and handles routing, request handling, and more. Examples include Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js), Spring Boot (Java), and Ruby on Rails (Ruby).
3. **API Documentation Tools:** Invest in tools that help generate comprehensive and interactive API documentation. Swagger (OpenAPI) and API Blueprint are popular choices for documenting APIs effectively.
4. **Version Control Client:** Familiarize yourself with a version control client to manage your codebase efficiently. Learn basic Git commands for committing, branching, merging, and more.

### Project Structure

Organize your API development project with a clear and logical structure:

1. **Directories:** Divide your project into directories for source code, tests, configuration files, and documentation.
2. **File Naming:** Use consistent and descriptive file names to make your codebase easier to navigate.
3. **Code Modularity:** Break down your code into modular components, following the Single Responsibility Principle. This enhances maintainability and readability.

### Version Control and Collaboration

Effective version control and collaboration practices are essential:

1. **Git Flow:** Adopt a version control workflow such as Git Flow to manage feature development, bug fixes, and releases systematically.
2. **Collaboration Platforms:** Use collaboration platforms like GitHub or GitLab for code review, issue tracking, and project management.

By setting up your development environment, selecting the right tools and technologies, and establishing solid version control and collaboration practices, you're well-prepared to embark on your API development journey.

## Request and Response Format

In API development, understanding and defining clear request and response formats is crucial for effective communication between clients and the server. Consistent formatting ensures that data is transmitted accurately and interpreted correctly. This section outlines the considerations and best practices for structuring request and response formats.

### Request Formats

When designing the request format, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Content-Type Header:** Specify the `Content-Type` header in the request to indicate the format of the request body. One of the most commonly used formats is the JSON (`application/json`).
2. **Data Serialization:** Serialize the data in the request body according to the chosen format. JSON is widely used due to its simplicity and compatibility with most programming languages.
3. **Data Validation:** Implement data validation on the server side to ensure that incoming data adheres to the expected format and constraints. Respond with appropriate error codes for validation failures.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Request Headers

The backend system is expected to return the following response headers as part of the API endpoints' functionality:

**1. Content Type and Encoding:**

All API endpoints that involve a request body are required to accept data with the content type `application/json` and the `UTF-8 encoding`.

 **Example:**

```Bash
POST /api/resource
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "key": "value"
}
```

**2. Preferred Client Language:**

All API endpoints should be designed to accommodate the preferred language of the client. This language preference is determined by the `accept-language` request header.

 **Example:**

```sql
GET /api/resource
Accept-Language: en-US

```
**3. Asynchronous Task Processing:**

In cases where asynchronous task processing is outlined in the requirements, endpoint actions can be scheduled for asynchronous processing. This is achieved by including the `x-accept-async` value in the request header and setting it to `true`.

 **Example:**

```csharp
POST /api/async-task
x-accept-async: true

{
    "task": "do_something"
}

```

> :memo: **`Note:`** Please ensure that the backend system adheres to these specifications in order to maintain consistent API behavior and communication.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Response Formats

For response formats, follow these best practices:

1. **Content-Type Header:** Set the `Content-Type` header in the response to indicate the format of the response body. Typically, this is `application/json` for JSON data.
2. **Consistent Structure:** Maintain a consistent structure for response objects across different endpoints. Include relevant metadata, data, and error details if applicable.
3. **Status Codes:** Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of the request. Common codes include 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized access, and 500 for internal server error.
4. **Error Responses:** Design clear and informative error responses that include an error code, message, and possibly additional details. This helps clients understand issues and take appropriate actions.

#### Response Headers

The backend system is expected to include the following response headers as part of the API endpoints' responses:

**1. JSON Format and Content-Type:**

For all API endpoints that include a response body, the returned data must be in JSON format. The response header's `Content-Type` should be set to `application/json`.

 **Example:**

```css
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "key": "value"
}
```

**2. x-reference-id for Request Tracking:**

All API endpoints are required to include an `x-reference-id` value in the response header. This value should be present regardless of the response status. The purpose of this value is to facilitate the tracking of request logs within the logging system.

 **Example:**

```css
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
x-reference-id: ABC123XYZ456

{
    "message": "Request processed successfully."
}
```

> :memo: **`Note`:** By adhering to these guidelines, the backend system will consistently provide responses in the specified JSON format and enable efficient tracking of request logs using the `x-reference-id` value.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

#### Response Codes

The application-level API responses are categorized into several response codes, each conveying a specific outcome of the request. These response codes guide the interaction between the client and the backend system:

##### **Successful Processing Response Codes**

```

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

##### **Failed Processing Response Codes**

* 400 - Bad Request - Request Validation Failed:
This response signifies that the request failed due to validation issues.

 **Example:**

```css
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "error": "Invalid input data."
}
```

* 401 - Unauthenticated Request - User Can't Be Identified:
This response indicates that the user's authentication could not be verified.

 **Example:**

```css

  }
  ```



## Endpoint Paths

When designing the endpoint paths for your API, it's essential to establish a consistent and descriptive structure that reflects the purpose of each endpoint. Following the guidelines below ensures clarity and understanding when navigating and utilizing the API. Examples are provided to illustrate how to create effective endpoint paths.

1. **Path Prefix and Plural Nouns:**
   - Begin each endpoint path with the prefix `api`.
   - Utilize plural nouns whenever possible to clearly represent the resources being accessed.
2. **Combining with Endpoint Verbs:**
   - Combine the endpoint path with the appropriate HTTP verb to identify the action performed on the resource.

### Examples:

1. **Retrieve the List of Organizations:**

   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Endpoint: `/api/organizations`
   - **Example** (Python - using Flask):

   ```python
   @app.route('/api/organizations', methods=['GET'])
   def get_organizations():
       # Logic to retrieve and return list of organizations
   ```

2. **Retrieve Organization by ID:**

   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Endpoint: `/api/organizations/{id}`
   - **Example** (Java - using Spring Boot):

   ```java
   @GetMapping("/api/organizations/{id}")
   public ResponseEntity<Organization> getOrganizationById(@PathVariable String id) {
       // Logic to retrieve organization by ID
   }
   ```

3. **Retrieve List of Sites by Organization:**

   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Endpoint: `/api/sites`
   - Query Parameter: `organizationId`
   - **Example** (Node.js - using Express.js):

   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/sites', (req, res) => {
       const organizationId = req.query.organizationId;
       // Logic to retrieve and return sites by organization ID
   });
   ```

4. **Create New Organization:**

   - HTTP Method: POST
   - Endpoint: `/api/organizations`
   - **Example** (C# - using ASP.NET Core):

   ```csharp
   [HttpPost("/api/organizations")]
   public IActionResult CreateOrganization([FromBody] Organization newOrganization) {
       // Logic to create a new organization
   }
   ```

5. **Update Organization:**

   - HTTP Method: PUT
   - Endpoint: `/api/organizations/{id}`
   - **Example** (Python - using Django):

   ```python
   @api_view(['PUT'])
   def update_organization(request, id):
       # Logic to update organization by ID
   ```

6. **Remove Organization:**

   - HTTP Method: DELETE
   - Endpoint: `/api/organizations/{id}`
   - **Example** (Ruby - using Ruby on Rails):

   ```ruby
   def destroy
       organization = Organization.find(params[:id])
       organization.destroy
       # Logic to delete organization by ID
   end
   ```



## Query Arguments

In addition to defining clear and structured endpoint paths, APIs often utilize query arguments to enhance functionality by allowing clients to specify preferences such as pagination, filtering, and sorting. This section outlines how query arguments can be effectively employed and provides comprehensive examples in various programming languages.

### Pagination

Pagination is a common requirement to efficiently manage large datasets. The following query arguments are commonly used for pagination:

- `limit`: An optional query argument specifying the number of records to return in the response. If not provided, the API's default configurable limit (e.g., 500 items) should be applied.
- `offset`: An optional query argument indicating how many records to skip when building the response. If not provided, the default offset is 0.
- All list endpoints should inherently support pagination.

**Example (Python - using Flask):**

```python
@app.route('/api/organizations', methods=['GET'])
def get_organizations():
    limit = request.args.get('limit', default=500, type=int)
    offset = request.args.get('offset', default=0, type=int)
    # Logic to retrieve organizations with pagination
```

### Filtering

Filtering allows clients to narrow down results based on specific criteria. Here are guidelines for applying filters:

- Use explicit search operators along with field names for text-based filtering, such as `nameContains`, `nameStartsWith`, `nameEndsWith`, or `nameEquals`.
- For range fields, explicitly specify boundaries with the field name, like `createdAtFrom`, `createdAtTo`, `siteCountFrom`, and `siteCountTo`.
- Use plural forms for filter parameters that accept lists of values, such as `ids` for filtering by IDs.
- All `GET` endpoints should support common filters like `ids`, `createdAtFrom`, `createdAtTo`, `updatedAtFrom`, and `updatedAtTo`.

**Example (Java - using Spring Boot):**

```java
@GetMapping("/api/organizations")
public ResponseEntity<List<Organization>> getOrganizations(
        @RequestParam(name = "nameContains", required = false) String nameContains,
        @RequestParam(name = "createdAtFrom", required = false) LocalDateTime createdAtFrom,
        @RequestParam(name = "createdAtTo", required = false) LocalDateTime createdAtTo) {
    // Logic to filter organizations based on query parameters
}
```

### Sorting

Sorting allows clients to receive results in a specified order. Use the following conventions:

- Define sorting with the direction specified as `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending) followed by the field name.
- If direction is not provided, `+` (ascending) should be applied.
- When no sorting is defined, the default sorting should apply.
- Default sorting can be based on common fields like `createdAt` or `name`.

**Example (Node.js - using Express.js):**

```javascript
app.get('/api/sites', (req, res) => {
    const sortBy = req.query.sortBy || '+createdAt';
    // Logic to retrieve and sort sites based on the specified field and direction
});
```

By incorporating these query argument strategies into your API endpoints, you provide clients with powerful tools to navigate, filter, and sort data efficiently and according to their specific needs.

## Default Response Formats

Ensuring a consistent and informative response format is essential for effective communication between your API and its consumers. This section outlines the default response formats that should be supported by all endpoints, along with comprehensive examples in various programming languages.

### Error Response Format

All endpoints should be capable of producing error responses following this JSON structure:

- `code`: A unique identifier (string or numeric) representing the exception.
- `message`: A user-friendly error message to be displayed by the UI.
- `details`: An optional error description, which could contain exception details during development but is typically null in production.
- `referenceId`: A unique identifier for the request, facilitating tracking in the logging system.

**Example (Java - using Spring Boot):**

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandlerController {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex, HttpServletRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse();
        errorResponse.setCode("E123");
        errorResponse.setMessage("An error occurred.");
        errorResponse.setDetails("Exception details...");
        errorResponse.setReferenceId(request.getAttribute("referenceId"));
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body(errorResponse);
    }
}
```

### List Response Format

List endpoints should consistently return data in the following JSON format:

- `totalCount`: The total number of records matching filter criteria (before pagination).
- `items`: An array of items that match the filter criteria and pagination.

**Example (Python - using Flask):**

```python
@app.route('/api/organizations', methods=['GET'])
def get_organizations():
    organizations = # Logic to retrieve organizations
    response = {
        "totalCount": len(organizations),
        "items": organizations
    }
    return jsonify(response)
```

### Single Record Response Format

Endpoints that retrieve single records should provide a flat JSON format containing fields required for updating and displaying the resource properly.

**Example (C# - using ASP.NET Core):**

```csharp
[HttpGet("/api/organizations/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetOrganizationById(int id) {
    var organization = _repository.GetOrganizationById(id);
    var response = new {
        id = organization.Id,
        name = organization.Name,
        // other relevant fields
    };
    return Ok(response);
}
```

### Create/Update Response Format

Endpoints responsible for creating or updating resources should return the entity reference and record version number.

**Example (Node.js - using Express.js):**

```javascript
app.post('/api/organizations', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to create organization
    const newOrganization = {
        id: generatedId,
        type: 'organization'
    };
    res.status(201).json(newOrganization);
});
```

### Async Processing Response Format

Endpoints supporting asynchronous processing for tasks should return task reference details.

**Example (Ruby - using Ruby on Rails):**

```ruby
def create_task
    # Logic to create async task
    task = {
        id: uniqueTaskId,
        type: 'task',
        actionType: 'command',
        actionName: 'data-processing'
    }
    render json: task, status: :accepted
end
```

By adopting these standardized response formats, you ensure a clear and structured communication between your API and its clients, enhancing user experience and facilitating efficient error handling.
